        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        q: What is smell?
        <br>a:
        <br>
        <br>q: Why should I chose matches via smell?
        <br>a: At Smell Dating we understand metrics of attraction are chemical, ultimately they’re a question of intercourse rather than interface. Yet the Internet has replaced fleshy experience with flat apparitions. The distance of the digital has replaced
        molecular intuition. That’s why at Smell Dating we offer you ways to connect with people in ways that go beyond pixels, algorithms and statistics. Our members make connections via long evolved, deeply intuitive cues rather than painstakingly curated
        profile pics.
        <br>
        <br>Smell researchers even speculate that high contemporary divorce rates may be related to the overuse of deodorants and the underuse of our olfactory intelligence. The Smell Dating mission, is to give you a way to reconnect with your sensory apparatus
        and use it to connect with people in new ways.
        <br>
        <br>q: Why don’t you ask participants about sexual orientation or gender?
        <br>a: Smell dating reconnects you with your intuition and saves you from your assumptions, pride and prejudices that often get in the way of ancient cues of attraction. There’s a growing body of scientific research exploring information that can
        be gleaned from body odor. Details of a person’s genetic compatibility, gender, age, and predisposition to illness can all be intuitively read from smell, not to mention notes of their habits and lifestyle.
        <br>
        <br>q: Should I wear deodorant or perfume during Smell Dating?
        <br>a: We recommend you refrain from wearing deodorant or perfume as it aggressively masks body odor. Embrace musky possibilities.
        <br>
        <br>q: Should I refrain from participating in smelly activities, such as smoking or barbeques during the course of the experience?
        <br>a: These sorts of activities will imbue odors to your sample however they are also rich cues to your potential matches of your lifestyle and activities.
        <br>
        <br>q: Why does this cost $30?
        <br>a: Our modest service fee covers the cost of our service, it covers the cost of a t-shirt and shipping costs. We are not profiting from this pilot program, our finances are available here.
        <br>
        <br>q: What contact information will be exchanged?
        <br>a: You be sent 10 samples from which to select matches. You will enter your preferred matches into our online database and will then be given the phone number of any mutual matches.
        <br>
        <br>q: Is my genetic data safe?
        <br>a: We really don’t know but rest assured, at Smell Dating we are committed to an intuitive experience of the world rather than an analytical one. For now, we will only share your genetic sample with our other members in a completely anonymised
        way. Our terms and conditions may change in the future based on our capricious whims.
        <br>
        <br>q: What if I match with someone outside my social, political or economic sphere?
        <br>a: Don’t worry, social stratification may well be legible in odor cues but you’ll just have to take a deep breath and trust yourself. Your nose knows.
